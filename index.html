						B & B stands for Brittany and Bailey. We are friends who have been lucky enough to become
						sister-in-laws. This baking operation has looked different and developed over the years but
						originates from Bailey and I enjoying our time spent together while baking. While we come from
						different areas and have different experiences, we have both grown up baking with our
						grandmas and mothers. This is what makes the baked goods so delicious! We have passion,
						love, and generations of experience behind our recipes that goes into the products. I, Brittany,
						have taken the main role for the bakery consisting of taking and fulfilling orders. However,
						consulting and sharing our bakeryâ€™s success with Bailey is one of my greatest joys. When you 
						read that every baked good is made with quality and love, it is true and here are some of the reasons why;

					<ul>
						<li> The Ingredients
							<ul>
								<li>Free range eggs to prevent animal cruelty and promote richer and healthier lifestyle</li>
								<li>Vanilla from Mexico supports those who produce it and have a better taste than imitation vanilla</li>
								<li>Flour (and gluten free flour) that is not processed and supports local business</li>
								<li>Chocolate and White Chocolate that is not generic but real to prevent graininess 
								and separation and promote taste in our products</li>
								<li>Fruit and Nuts that are locally sourced and fresh. Over the years I have hated discovering when something 
								is out of season or underripe so I hand pick every add in that goes into our product.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li> Some Text
							<ul>
								<li>Baking has always been a way to express to others how much we love and care about them. A loaf of bread or 
								a cookie is the best way I know how to show others they matter.</li>
								<li>It may sound cheesy but every product made is like a small piece of my heart to show love through baking</li>
								<li>We have both been baking since we were young and have carried it with us from our childhood home, to our adult 
								homes, and are honored to have a piece of that go into your homes.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

						As customers of B & B I am happy to share some of the reasons we take such pride in our
						products. In the past this was more of a hobby where sometimes we broke even and sometimes
						the joy of giving others a baked good was satisfaction enough. However, as more orders are
						coming in and we are expanding B & B to the next level prices have slightly been adjusted.
						Nothing has increased by more than a dollar or two. This is to make sure that the quality of our
						products can be upheld as well as making sure the operation can continue. We eagerly look
						forward to seeing you the next time you order from B & B Bakery!
